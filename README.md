### Overview
****

PlumPantry is an ingredient-based food suggestions app. Recipes link to other recipes with similar ingredients lists, therefore giving users the maximum amount of dishes they can prepare with the minimum amount of ingredients needed for purchase.

Users can add dishes to a favorites list, and are given a compiled grocery lists based on their favorite recipes' ingredients.

### Purpose
****

This is my first project at General Assembly for the Web Development Immersive Course. 
This is my first project where I've :

*	had users
*	authorized and authenticated users
*	deployed to heroku
*	made a full working rails app

I am super proud of:

*	 my self-stylingâ€”no frameworks used!
*	 getting large image files for each recipe, despite Yummly not providing them. Made a bit of a hack for that.
*	 Suggestive user sign in.
*	 Features that only appear if users are authenticated.

### Technology
****

*	Yummly's API.
*	Yummly gem
*	bcrypt-ruby 3.0.0
*	rails_12factor
