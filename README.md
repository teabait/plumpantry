#### purpose
****
PlumPantry is an ingredients-based recipe suggestion app. Users select recipes they like and are presented with other recipes that share similar ingredients. This allows users to make more dishes while reusing ingredients, thus saving grocery trips and money. 

#### overview
****
This is my first project for General Assembly's Web Development Immersive.
It is the first project where I have:

*	users
*	authentification and authorization for users
*	deployed a working rails app

I am most proud of:

*	my self styling—no frameworks!
*	working around limitations of the Yummly API—example: they only give small image URLS and I created a method that takes that url and substitutes characters to get a large image.
*	making different lists from the API interactive and meaningful.
*	creating an app I'd like to use.

#### technology
****
*	Yummly API
*	Yummly gem
*	bcrypt-ruby 3.0.0 
*	rails 4.0.0
*	rails_12factor
